]1] We npm init our main folder to get package.json
2] add this all to our github using git.
3] We create a public/temp folder and add .gitkeep so that git keeps track of our empty folders too.
4] Create gitignore and add all the necessary data from .gitignore generator
5] create .env
6] create src folder and add reqd files in it 
(Admin@DESKTOP-UMDT2C6 MINGW64 /d/X_Web Develpoment/2_Chai Aur Backend/MegaYT/src (main)
$ touch app.js constants.js index.js)

7] set type:"moudle" in json

8] get nodemon(it restarts server automatically everytime we save)

(dev dependency:-means its only used during Develpomentand not for production & normal dependency stay even during production)

npm i -D nodemon   (i as devDependency)

change run srcipt to dev

9]  Add required folders in src 
$ mkdir controllers db middlewares models routes utils      (this is how pros do it)
Add the changes to github (Now we are done with structuring our project)

10] npm i -D prettier  --> Coz many people work on same project we i this devDependency to keep the formatting same throughout

    Add .prettierrc file in root(not src) 
    Add .prettierignore
